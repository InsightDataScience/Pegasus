## Project Pegasus - Flying in the Cloud with Automated AWS Deployment
![pegasus_logo](Pegasus_small.jpg)

[![Build Status](http://52.41.136.144:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=MASTER-pegasus)](http://jenkins.insightdataprod.com:8080/job/MASTER-pegasus/)

Pegasus is released under Apache License v2.0 and enables anyone with an Amazon Web Services ([AWS] (http://aws.amazon.com/)) account to quickly deploy a number of distributed technologies all from their laptop or personal computer. The installation is fairly basic and should not be used for production. The purpose of this project is to enable fast protoyping of various distributed data pipelines and also help others explore distributed technologies without the headache of installing them.

We want to continue improving this tool by adding more features and other installations, so send us your pull requests or suggestions!

# Install Pegasus on your local machine
This will allow you to programatically interface with your AWS account. There are two methods to install Pegasus: using a pre-baked Docker image or manually installing it into your environment.

#### Prerequisites
* AWS account
* VPC with DNS Resolution enabled
* Subnet in VPC
* Security group accepting all inbound and outbound traffic (recommend locking down ports depending on technologies)
* AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key ID

### Manual

Clone the Pegasus project to your local computer and install awscli
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus.git
$ pip install awscli
```

Next we need to add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`.
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=XX-XXXX-X
export REM_USER=ubuntu
export PEGASUS_HOME=<path-to-pegasus>
export PATH=$PEGASUS_HOME:$PATH
```
Source the `.bash_profile` when finished.
```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Docker

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`.
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=XX-XXXX-X
```
Source the `.bash_profile` when finished.
```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

Execute the `run_peg_docker.sh` script
```bash
$ ./run_peg_docker.sh <pem-key-name> <path-to-folder-with-instance-template-files>
```

Everytime the container is started fresh, you will need to enable the ssh-agent otherwise you will not be able to SSH into your AWS nodes
```bash
root@containerid$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
```

## Verify installation
Once the Docker container is running or you have set up Pegasus manually, you can verify the current configurations in Pegasus with `peg config`
```bash
$ peg config
AWS access key: ASDFQWER1234ZXCV
AWS secret key: POIUYTERRLKJHGFSD123498735284hdb+H
AWS region:     us-west-2
AWS SSH User:   ubuntu
```

You can test your AWS-CLI access by querying for the available regions for your AWS account:
```bash
$ aws ec2 --output json describe-regions --query Regions[].RegionName
[
    "eu-west-1",
    "ap-southeast-1",
    "ap-southeast-2",
    "eu-central-1",
    "ap-northeast-2",
    "ap-northeast-1",
    "us-east-1",
    "sa-east-1",
    "us-west-1",
    "us-west-2"
]
```

# Query for AWS VPC information
The following queries can help you quickly determine which subnet-id and security-group-id to use in your instance deployments.

## VPCs
Let's say we want to deploy our instances in the VPC named `my-vpc`. We can view all VPCs in my region with `peg aws vpcs`
```bash
$ peg aws vpcs
VPCID		    NAME
vpc-add2e6c3	default
vpc-c2a496a1	my-vpc
```
We can see that `vpc-c2a496a1` is the VPC id we would need my subnet-id and security-group-id associated with.

## Subnets
To choose the specific subnet-id we will use in my deployment, we can view all Subnets in our region with `peg aws subnets`
```bash
$ peg aws subnets
VPCID		    AZ		    IPS	    SUBNETID	    NAME
vpc-c2a496a1	us-west-2c	251	    subnet-6ac0bd26	private-subnet-west-2c
vpc-add2e6c3	us-west-2b	4089	subnet-9fe6e3df	aws-us-west-2b
```
We see here that the first subnet is associated with the same VPC id we specified previously, so `subnet-6ac0bd26` is the subnet-id I will need to use in my instance deployment later on.

We can also filter the Subnets down to a specific VPC name with `peg aws subnets <vpc-name>` if we have too many subnets to search through
```bash
$ peg aws subnets my-vpc
VPCID		    AZ		    IPS	    SUBNETID	    NAME
vpc-c2a496a1	us-west-2c	251	    subnet-6ac0bd26	private-subnet-west-2c
```

## Security groups
The last network related information we would need for our instance deployment is the security-group-id. We can view all Security Groups in our region with `peg aws security-groups`
```bash
$ peg aws security-groups
VPCID		    SGID		GROUP NAME
vpc-add2e6c3	sg-7cb78418	default
vpc-c2a496a1	sg-5deed039	default
```
We would choose the `sg-5deed039` in this example, since it is also associated with the VPC that we wish to deploy in.

We can also filter Security Groups down to a specific VPC name `peg aws security-groups <vpc-name>` if there are too many security groups to search through
```bash
$ peg aws security-groups my-vpc
VPCID		    SGID		GROUP NAME
vpc-c2a496a1	sg-5deed039	default
```

# Spin up your cluster on AWS
Use `peg up` to deploy a cluster from the command line (recommended)
```bash
$ peg up <instance-template-file>
```

The `instance-template-file` is a yaml file that `peg up` uses. Examples of these can be found under `${PEG_ROOT}/examples`. Within this file you should specify the following as shown:
```bash
purchase_type: spot or on_demand
subnet_id: string
price: string
num_instances: integer
key_name: string
security_group_ids: string
instance_type: string
tag_name: string
vol_size: integer
role: master or worker
use_eips: true or false
```
* **purchase_type** (*string*) - choose between on_demand or spot instances
* **subnet_id** (*string*) - the VPC subnet id (e.g. subnet-61c12804)
* **price** (*string*) - spot price you would like to set. Ignored if `purchase_type`=`on_demand` (e.g. 0.25)
* **num_instances** (*integer*) - number of instances to deploy
* **key_name** (*string*) - the pem key name to be used for all instances (e.g. insight-cluster)
* **security_group_ids** (*string*) - security group id (e.g. sg-e9f17e8c, does not support multiple security group ids yet)
* **instance_type** (*string*) - type of instances to deploy (e.g. m4.xlarge)
* **tag_name** (*string*) - tag all your instances with this name. Instances with the same `tag_name` will be associated with the same cluster.  This will be known as the `cluster-name` throughout the rest of the README (e.g. test-cluster)
* **vol_size** (*integer*) - size of the EBS volume in GB. Uses magnetic storage. (e.g. 100)
* **role** (*string*) - role of the instances (e.g. master)
* **use_eips** (*boolean*) - use Elastic IPs with instances or not

You can check if the template file is valid with `peg validate <template-file`.

The AMIs used in the `peg up` script have some basic packages baked in such as Java 7, Python, Maven 3, and many others. You can refer to the [`install/environment/setup_single.sh`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/install/environment/install_env.sh) to view all the packages that have been installed. This should save quite a bit of time whenever you provision a new cluster. Reinstalling these packages can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes.

# Fetching AWS cluster DNS and hostname information
Once the nodes are up and running on AWS, we'll need to grab the DNS and hostname information about the cluster you wish to work with on your local machine.

Always run `peg fetch` to store the instance Public DNSs and hostnames onto your local machine before installation. Public DNSs and hostnames will be saved into the `tmp` folder under the specified cluster name as `public_dns` and `hostnames` respectively
```bash
$ peg fetch <cluster-name>
```
Under the `${PEG_ROOT}/tmp/<cluster-name>` folder you will find the `public_dns` and `hostnames` files. The first record in each file is considered the Master node for any cluster technology that has a Master-Worker setup.

`${PEG_ROOT}/tmp/<cluster-name>/public_dns`
```bash
ec2-52-32-227-84.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com  **MASTER**
ec2-52-10-128-74.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com  **WORKER1**
ec2-52-35-15-97.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com   **WORKER2**
ec2-52-35-11-46.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com   **WORKER3**
```
`${PEG_ROOT}/tmp/<cluster-name>/hostnames`
```bash
ip-172-31-38-105 **MASTER**
ip-172-31-39-193 **WORKER1**
ip-172-31-42-254 **WORKER2**
ip-172-31-44-133 **WORKER3**
```

You can always view the current cluster information stored locally with the `peg describe <cluster-name>` command

Once the cluster IPs have been saved to the tmp folder, we can begin with installations.

# Describe a cluster
Shows the hostname and Public DNS for a specified cluster and also show which nodes are the Master and Workers.
```bash
$ peg describe <cluster-name>
```

# Setting up a newly provisioned AWS cluster
If this is a newly provisioned AWS cluster, always start with at least the following 3 steps in the following order before proceeding with other installations. You can skip the first step if you are using the `peg up` command, since the packages have already been installed.

1. **Environment/Packages** - installs basic packages for Python, Java and many others **(not needed if using peg up)**
1. **Passwordless SSH** - enables passwordless SSH from your computer to the MASTER and the MASTER to all the WORKERS. This is needed for some of the technologies.
2. **AWS Credentials** - places AWS keys onto all machines under `~/.profile`
```bash
$ peg install <cluster-name> environment    # not needed if using peg up!!!
$ peg install <cluster-name> ssh
$ peg install <cluster-name> aws
```

# Start installing!
```bash
$ peg install <cluster-name> <technology>
```
The `technology` tag can be any of the following:
* alluxio (v1.0.0)
* cassandra (v3.7)
* elasticsearch (v2.3.3)
* flink (v1.1.2 with hadoop v2.7 and scala v2.10)
* hadoop (v2.7.2)
* hbase (v1.2.1)
* hive (v1.2.1)
* kafka (v0.10.0.0 with scala v2.10)
* kafka-manager (v1.3.1.8+)
* kibana (v4.5.1)
* opscenter
* pig (v0.15.0)
* presto (v0.147)
* redis (v3.2.0)
* secor (v0.21+)
* spark (v1.6.1 with hadoop v2.6+)
* storm (v1.0.1)
* zeppelin (v0.6.1+)
* zookeeper (v3.4.6)

All environment variables relating to technology folder paths are stored in `~/.profile` such as `HADOOP_HOME`, `SPARK_HOME` and so on.

If you wish to install a different version of these technologies, go into the [`install/download_tech`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/install/download_tech) script and update the technology version and technology binary download URL.

Additional technologies can be included into Pegasus by adding the technology version and url to [`install/download_tech`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/install/download_tech), writing the appropriate configurations in the `config` folder and writing the appropriate service scripts in the `service` folder if appropriate.

# Starting and stopping services
User the `service` option to start and stop distributed services easily without having to manually SSH into each node
```bash
$ peg service <cluster-name> <technology> <start|stop>
```

# Uninstalling a technology
A script has been provided to uninstall a specific technology from all nodes in the declared cluster
```bash
$ peg uninstall <cluster-name> <technology>
```

# SSH into a node
If you need to SSH into a specific node in a cluster, you can use `peg ssh` to easily reference nodes
```bash
$ peg ssh <cluster-name> <node-number>
```
where `node-number` is the order in which the nodes appear in the `hostnames` and `public_dns` files starting with 1 (master node)

# Terminate a cluster
Tears down an on-demand or spot cluster on AWS
```bash
$ peg down <cluster-name>
```

# Retag a cluster
Rename an existing cluster on AWS
```bash
$ peg retag <cluster-name> <new-cluster-name>
```

# Starting and stopping on demand clusters
Place a cluster into running and stop modes on AWS. This is particularly useful if you don't want to reinstall technologies each time you begin your workflow. Stopped instances are not charged to your account; however the Elastic IPs and EBS volumes will still incur charges.
```bash
$ peg start <cluster-name>
```
```bash
$ peg stop <cluster-name>
```

# Port forwarding to a node
Forward your local port to a remote node's port. This is useful if you have any services that can only be accessed through port-forwarding.
```bash
$ peg port-forward <cluster-name> <node-number> <local-port>:<remote-port>
```

# Deployment Pipelines
If you'd like to automate this deployment process completely, you can write your own scripts. An example has been provided in the [`examples/spark_hadoop.sh`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/examples/spark/spark_hadoop.sh) file.

Here it shows how we can spin up a 4 node cluster (peg up) using the [`spark_master.yml`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/examples/spark/spark_master.yml) and [`spark_workers.yml`](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pegasus/blob/master/examples/spark/spark_workers.yml) instance templates, grab the cluster information using `peg fetch` and install all the technologies with `peg install` in one script. We can deploy this cluster simply by changine the subnet-id and security-group-ids in the instance-template-files and then running the following:
```bash
$ examples/spark/spark_hadoop.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

PEG_ROOT=$(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../..

CLUSTER_NAME=test-cluster

peg up ${PEG_ROOT}/example/spark_master.yml &
peg up ${PEG_ROOT}/example/spark_workers.yml &

wait

peg fetch $CLUSTER_NAME

peg install ${CLUSTER_NAME} ssh
peg install ${CLUSTER_NAME} aws
peg install ${CLUSTER_NAME} hadoop
peg install ${CLUSTER_NAME} spark
```
